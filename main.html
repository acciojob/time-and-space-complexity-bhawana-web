    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a critical aspect of algorithm analysis. It measures how the execution time of an algorithm 
        changes as the input size increases. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to perform tasks 
        in the least amount of time, especially for large inputs.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        For example, an algorithm with a linear relationship between the input size and memory usage is considered 
        to have <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n), where n is the size of the input. This means that the memory usage grows 
        proportionally with the input size.
