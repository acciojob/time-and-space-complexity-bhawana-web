    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of the input. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize the time it takes to process data, ensuring that the solution scales well even for large inputs. Time complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, which helps in analyzing the worst-case scenario of an algorithm.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires relative to the input size. For instance, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity means that the memory usage increases linearly with the input size. Space complexity is crucial in evaluating how efficiently an algorithm uses memory, especially when working with large datasets or limited resources.</p>
