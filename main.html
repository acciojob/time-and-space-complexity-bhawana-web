    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a concept used to describe the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, relative to the size of the input. The goal is to analyze how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. An efficient algorithm aims to minimize time complexity, often seeking to optimize it to a logarithmic or linear scale rather than quadratic or exponential.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. Similar to time complexity, the goal is to minimize space usage. In most cases, space complexity is expressed using Big O notation, such as <strong>O(n)</strong>, where the space required grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
